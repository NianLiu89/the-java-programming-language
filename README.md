#   THE Java™ Programming Language, Fourth Edition
This is the place where I took notes and practices while learning this book.

##  1. A Quick Tour
### Unicode chars
Java supports unicode characters, which means that you can define variable with name like 兀 or 念.
### String Objects
* String objects are read-only, or immutable. The classes StringBuilder and StringBuffer provide for mutable strings.
* Use %n instead \n, it gives correct line separator based on the platform.
